  This page lists mirror servers where you can download openSUSE. The below
  comprehensive table shows what you will find on which mirror. It is
  <em>not a static</em> and outdated list &mdash; it is generated every 30
  minutes and reflects the last state which was seen by probing. Thus it should
  be highly accurate regarding content and availability of mirrors. This page was created on
  %(utc)s.
  </p>

  <p>
  The master download server, 
  <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/">download.opensuse.org</a>,
  automatically redirects you to a server near you. The information on this
  page is generated directly off the database used by the master download
  server. So under normal circumstances, there should be no need to use mirrors
  directly, and look at this table for that purpose.  If you <em>do</em> see
  the need, there <a href="https://status.opensuse.org/">might be something wrong</a> and it would be appreciated if you
  <a href="mailto:admin@opensuse.org">notify the admins</a> about it, so it can be fixed for the benefit of yourself,
  and possibly many other users.

  <p>
  For downloading CD or DVD images, there is
  <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/">software.opensuse.org</a> 
  to help with choosing the correct download. It also uses the below mirrors.
  <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Distribution">Additional information</a>
  about downloading openSUSE can be found in the openSUSE wiki.
  </p>

  <p>
  The best (and fastest!) way to download CD or DVD images is with a Metalink client.
